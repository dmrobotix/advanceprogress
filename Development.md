# Development

To quickly get started with this app you can use docker (https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

This will simplify installing dependencies and managing configuration. First install docker and then
simply run `docker-compose up`. The app should now be running on on port 8000.

To shut down the server use `docker-compose down`
